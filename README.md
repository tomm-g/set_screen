# set_screen
.sh file to fix issue of 1920x1080 not being available w/ Ubuntu VM in VirtualBox


************
Steps To Use
************

1. Make executable with command "chmod -x /PATH/TO/FILE

2. cd to directory where setscreen.sh is saved (I save to my home directory for ease of access)

3. run setscreen.sh with command ./setscreen.sh

Notes:

I advise making setscreen.sh executable w start-up
  In Gnome, done through start-up settings
  In i3 WM, added to i3 config
